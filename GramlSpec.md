# Graml Specification
Version: 1.0  

## Overview
Graml is essentially a YAML schema.
It is a constrained form of YAML 1.1 as *as implemented* by [SnakeYAML](http://snakeyaml.org).
This means all YAML features such as arrays, associative-arrays, aliases, anchors, merge keys, etc. are valid in Graml.
