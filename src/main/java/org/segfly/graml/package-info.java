/**
 * Graml is a YAML-based graph modeling language. It natively supports the Tinkerpop Blueprints API and will therefore
 * work with any Tinkerpop supported graph database. The current reference implementation of Graml has been developed
 * for use with OrientDb and is not yet tested with other databases. Other databases with capabilities, (e.g. lack
 * of object-oriented support) may or may not work with the current reference implementation.
